## Simulation Start

When you run the simulation, you will be asked to provide some parameters:

1. **Battery**: You will be asked if you want to run the simulation with a battery. Enter 'yes' if you want to include a battery in the simulation, or 'no' if you don't.

2. **Off-Grid**: You will be asked if you want to run the simulation off-grid. Enter 'yes' if you want the simulation to be off-grid, or 'no' if you want it to be connected to the grid.

3. **Selling Back to the Grid**: You will be asked if you want to sell excess energy back to the grid. Enter 'yes' if you want to sell excess energy back to the grid, or 'no' if you don't.

## Simulation Workflow

### Initialization
1. **Configuration Loading**: The simulation starts by loading all necessary configurations from JSON files. These configurations include settings for batteries, inverters, solar panels, and other described above.
2. **Parameter Setting**: Default parameters for the inverter and battery are set based on the loaded configurations.

### Simulation Setup
3. **User Input**: The user is prompted to input simulation options such as including a battery, running in off-grid mode, handling low tariff periods, and enabling energy selling.
4. **Initial Status Display**: Before proceeding, the simulation prints the initial configuration based on the user's inputs.
5. **Data Handling**:
   - **Data Extraction**: If new consumption data is required, it is extracted from the specified databases.
   - **Data Resampling**: The consumption data is resampled to align with the simulationâ€™s time steps.

### Simulation Execution
6. **Simulation Start**: The simulation process begins, using the setup parameters and user inputs.
7. **Solar Energy Calculation**: Solar energy production is calculated based on the location and panel configurations.
8. **Energy Processing**:
   - If a battery is included, battery dynamics are simulated considering the configured parameters.
   - Energy transactions (consumption and sales to the grid) are computed, especially focusing on tariff variations if enabled.

### Optimization (Optional)
9. **Optimization Prompt**: The user is asked whether to proceed with optimization, which aims to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the system.
    **NOTE** -always try to do optimization of ROI with real yearly data. Extrapolation has high impact on the consumption during various months.  

10. **Genetic Algorithm**: If proceeded with optimization, a genetic algorithm is run to find the best configuration of panels, battery, and inverter that yields the highest return on investment (ROI).
11. **Optimization Results**: The results, including the best configuration and the improved ROI, are displayed.

### Finalization

12. **Results Saving**: All final configurations and simulation results are saved in a JSON file for later review or documentation.



## Modules
Here is an overview of the key modules in the simulation:
- **Database Extraction**: Manages large datasets from databases.
- **Phases CSV Merging**: Merges various CSV files related to different simulation phases.
- **Phase Grouping**: Organizes data into phases for further analysis.
- **Data Extrapolation**: Extends consumption data -- used mainly for testing purposes of optimization, if possible always use just real data. But for optimization of ROI we need whole year data. 
- **Solar Production**: Calculates solar energy based on specific parameters.
- **PV Optimizer**: Optimizes PV system configurations.
- **Energy Processing**: Processes energy data for simulation purposes.
